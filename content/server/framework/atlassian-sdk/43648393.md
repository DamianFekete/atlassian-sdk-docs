# Documentation : How do I check if Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK) is installed?

You can check which version of JAVA you have installed on your system by opening a Terminal window and running the following command:

``` javascript
javac -version
```

If you're running the Oracle JAVA 8 you'll see a response like 

``` javascript
javac 1.8.0_101
```

 

If you see an error like 'command not found' or just no response, then you'll need to install the Java SE Development Kit.  

You can get this at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" class="external-link">Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8 Downloads</a>.
