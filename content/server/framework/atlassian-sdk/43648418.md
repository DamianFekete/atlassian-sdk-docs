# Documentation : I get a BUILD FAILURE Error with 'Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory'

### Symptoms

You might come across the following error when you try to start up your plugin using the `atlas-run` command if you have not changed to the directory with the plugin skeleton you created:

``` java
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 0.135 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2016-09-30T15:29:49+10:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 5M/245M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.atlassian.maven.plugins:maven-amps-dispatcher-plugin:6.2.6:run (default-cli): Goal requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory (/Users/mpaisley/Test). Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory. -> [Help 1]
```

### How to fix it

Make sure you're in **your plugin directory** and make sure the **`pom.xml`** file has been created.Â
