# Maven parsing error unrecognised HTML tag

You may receive a Maven error: "Parsing error.... Unrecognized tag: 'html'"

Occasionally, our Maven proxy will return a 404 file instead of the POM that it should. We are investigating this error (XPR-259) with the Archiva developers. In the mean time, should this happen to you, you should try remove the artifact and its POM from your local repository to force a re-download. If that does not work, contact [our developer relations team](https://developer.atlassian.com/help#contact-us) and we will correct the problem at the source.
