### Fisheye/Crucible

This page contains answers to frequently asked questions posed by FishEye/Crucible developers.

Feel free to comment, make submissions, or pose your own question on FishEye/Crucible Development here.

-   **Q**: *I'm getting the error "API access is disabled" as a response from* <a href="http://fisheye/api/rest/repositories" class="uri external-link">http://fisheye/api/rest/repositories</a> *on my installation. How do I enable the API as a Fisheye administrator?*

    **A**: There is a toggle to enable the API under "Server Settings" in the web admin interface. See <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Configuring+the+FishEye+web+server" class="external-link">Configuring the FishEye web server</a> for more details.

     

<!-- -->

-   **Q**: *Is there any way to return unique results from an EyeQL query?*

    **A**: It is not currently possible to return unique results.  
    An improvement request exists: <a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-1136" class="external-link">FE-1136</a>. Your vote and comments on that issue are appreciated.

-   **Q**: *How do I use AUI on a page generated by a servlet plugin module?*

    **A**: FishEye 2.4 and earlier don't include AUI by default, so your servlet will need to explicitly include it. There are two ways to do this:

    1.  In FishEye/Crucible 2.4 and later, specify that the context of its [page decorator](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/FECRUDEV/Page+Decorators) requires the `com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs` resource. i.e. your `atlassian-plugin.xml` file should include:

        ``` xml
        <web-resource key="aui">
            <dependency>com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs</dependency>
            <context>atl.general</context>
        </web-resource>
        ```

        assuming your generated page will request the `atl.general` decorator.

    2.  If you are rendering a velocity template, include `$webResourceManager.requireResource('com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs')` in your template.
