# Documentation : Plugin Hosting with Atlassian

Looking for someplace to host your plugin? Atlassian is happy to offer two choices for plugin project hosting:

### **Bitbucket**

Bitbucket is a distributed version control system (DVCS) code hosting site that supports Mercurial and Git. The service offering includes an issue tracker and wiki, as well as integration with a number of popular services such as Basecamp, Flowdock and Twitter. Bitbucket offers unlimited public and private repositories, with up to 5 users per repository, at no charge. We feel it is an excellent choice for open source projects and more than adequate for hosting Atlassian plugin development; in fact, we <a href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/" class="external-link">use it ourselves</a> for that purpose!

### **JIRA, Confluence, and Bamboo Cloud**

Atlassian offers several additional core products in the cloud environment. Sign up for a single cloud site that includes a combination of JIRA, Confluence, and Bamboo in a customizable hosted environment. We recommend this setup for big teams and large-scale plugin development. Configure the entire site to your specific needs, knowing that Atlassian's <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings" class="external-link">legendary support</a> is always an email away. You can check out pricing for products available in the cloud <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/cloud/ordering#overview-1" class="external-link">here</a>.

Many projects are still available at our legacy hosting site: <a href="http://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/" class="uri external-link">http://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/</a>. If you have any questions, please let us know at <a href="mailto:developer-relations@atlassian.com" class="external-link">developer-relations@atlassian.com</a>.
