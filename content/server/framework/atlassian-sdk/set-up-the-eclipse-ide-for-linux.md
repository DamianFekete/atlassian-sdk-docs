# Set up the Eclipse IDE for Linux

This tutorial is no longer available. 

IDE's such as Eclipse are constantly changing and improving and it's easy for a tutorial to become outdated.

Rather than try to keep a document up to date here, we would recommend you check out the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/users/" class="external-link">Eclipse Getting Started guide</a> which will have set up instructions for the latest version of Eclipse.
