# REST plugin 2.2 release notes

**13 September 2010**

With pleasure, Atlassian presents the **Atlassian REST Plugin 2.2**.

Highlights of this release:

-   **Secure administration sessions.** Atlassian REST 2.2, when paired with [SAL 2.2](https://developer.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5242917), provides support for secure administration sessions, the aptly-named 'WebSudo'. Confluence already supports ï»¿<a href="#websudo" class="unresolved">WebSudo</a>: When an administrator who is logged into Confluence attempts to access an administration function, they are prompted to log in again. Eventually, all the Atlassian applications will support WebSudo sessions. How can you get WebSudo with REST? See the [SAL documentation](/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/adding-websudo-support-to-your-plugin).

<!-- -->

-   **Faster startup time.** Now some Spring files are bundled with the REST plugin, thus minimising the effort of the plugin framework to load it. In addition, the REST plugin no longer bundles its own copy of JAXB, significantly reducing the number of classes it needs to load.
