# Documentation : \_REST Plugin Module Overview

You can use the REST plugin module to create plugin points easily in Atlassian applications, by exposing services and data entities as REST APIs. The Atlassian REST plugin module is bundled with our applications.

REST APIs provide access to resources via URI paths. To use a REST API, your plugin or script will make an HTTP request and parse the response. You can choose JSON or XML for the response format. Your methods will be the standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. Because the REST API is based on open standards, you can use any web development language to access the API.
