# Plugin modules that require a restart

Plugin modules can be marked with an `@RequiresRestart` annotation which means the plugin will not be reloaded until the application server is restarted. See [Plugins that Cannot be Reloaded with FastDev or pi](/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/plugins-that-cannot-be-reloaded-with-fastdev-or-pi-2818391.html).
