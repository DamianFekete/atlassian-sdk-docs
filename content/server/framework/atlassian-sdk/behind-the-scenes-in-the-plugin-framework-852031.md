# Behind the scenes in the Plugin Framework

The SDK hides much of the complexity of the underlying OSGi framework from you. If you're developing a simple plugin, you probably won't have to think about it at all. However, as you start to develop more advanced plugins or when you have to troubleshoot, it's useful to know how the Atlassian Plugin Framework works behind the scenes. The technologies underlying the framework, such as OSGi and Spring, give you tremendous flexibility for developing powerful plugins.Â 

The following topics provide this background information on the framework.
