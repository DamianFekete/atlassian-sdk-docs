# Documentation : \_SDK Known Issues

## Known Issues

### General SDK issues

-   If a plugin is in a directory with spaces in the name, the SDK commands will not work properly (<a href="https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/AMPS-126" class="external-link">AMPS-126</a>). To work around this, make sure the plugin directory has no spaces.
-   The SDK cannot deploy applications to the root context (e.g., `http://localhost:1990`) (<a href="https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/AMPS-122" class="external-link">AMPS-122</a>). To work around this, use a named context.

### Product-specific issues

None for recent versions.
