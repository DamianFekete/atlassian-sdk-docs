# Documentation : Atlassian Product Overview for Developers

All of the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/" class="external-link">Atlassian products</a> are extensible. Each one has unique capabilities and requirements, as described in our product tutorials and references.

Before you start, drop in on the [quick start guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS). Then dive into the product-specific references below.

## JIRA

So you're thinking of customising [JIRA](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV), our issue tracker and project planning tool? Maybe you want to [change the way JIRA looks](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+templates+and+JSPs). Or [create a custom field type](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/Tutorial+-+Creating+a+custom+field+type). Take a look at the [JIRA plugin guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/About+JIRA+Plugin+Development) or interact with JIRA via the [remote APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+APIs).

## JIRA Software

Doing agile development - Scrum, Kanban, another variant? [JIRA Software](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+Software+development+guide) the \#1 software development tool used by agile teams. See how to build your own plugin [on top of JIRA Agile](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+Agile+development+guide).

## JIRA Mobile Connect

Are you developing a mobile application? Learn how to use [JIRA Mobile Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JMC) to log issues directly from the app.

## Confluence

[Confluence](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV) is a collaboration platform you can use for project planning, design, knowledge management, documentation, or as a company intranet--you name it. There are two main ways to develop with Confluence: using the remote API or developing an add-on. If you're integrating Confluence with another application, you'll most likely want to use the [remote API](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFCLOUD/Confluence+REST+API). If you'd like to add capabilities to Confluence, an [add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFCLOUD/Confluence+Connect+patterns) may be the answer. For a quick customisation that requires only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, try a [user macro](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Confluence+User+Macro+Guide).

You can develop add-ons for [Confluence Cloud](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFCLOUD) or [Server](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV).

## Fisheye and Crucible

[FishEye and Crucible](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/FECRUDEV) add reporting, visualisation, notifications, code sharing and peer review to your source repository. Develop [plugins and gadgets](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/FECRUDEV/FishEye+and+Crucible+Plugin+Guide) to extend FishEye and Crucible. Use the [remote APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/FECRUDEV/Remote+API+Reference) to integrate FishEye and Crucible software with other systems.

## Bamboo

Got continuous integration? Then you've got [Bamboo](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOODEV), a build server that does more than mindlessly run your builds over and over. Enhance Bamboo's awesomeness by building a [plugin](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOODEV/Bamboo+Plugin+Guide) or check the [remote APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOODEV/REST+APIs).

## Crowd

[Crowd](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CROWDDEV) is a web application that manages users, permissions and application access control. It offers a number of out-of-the-box connectors for well known applications and directories. If yours is not one of them, you can write a [custom connector](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CROWDDEV/Remote+API+Reference). You can also add to Crowd functionality by writing a [plugin](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CROWDDEV/Developing+Plugins+for+Crowd).
