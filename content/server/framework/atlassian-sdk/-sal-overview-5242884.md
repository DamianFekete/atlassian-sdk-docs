# Documentation : \_SAL Overview

The Shared Access Layer, or SAL for short, provides a consistent, cohesive API to common plugin tasks, regardless of the Atlassian application into which your plugin is deployed. SAL is most useful for cross-application plugin development. If you are developing your plugin for a single application only, you can simply use the application's own API. If your plugin will run in two applications or more, you will find SAL's services useful. These common services include, but are not limited to:

-   Job scheduling
-   Internationalisation lookups
-   Persistence for plugin settings
-   A plugin upgrade framework
