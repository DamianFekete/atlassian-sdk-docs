# Documentation : Overriding the application's webapp when developing your plugin

The <a href="https://maven.atlassian.com/public/com/atlassian/amps/atlassian-plugin-sdk" class="external-link">Atlassian Plugin SDK</a> makes it easy to override any component of the application's webapp.

1.  Create a `src/test/resources/***-app` directory, where `***` is the name of the application you're developing your plugin against. For example `confluence`.
2.  To this directory add the resources you want to add (or override) following the webapp directory structure.

Now when you run your application via `atlas-run`, `atlas-debug` and/or `atlas-integration-test`, it will use the updated WAR built from the application configured in your `pom.xml` and the added resources you have defined.

## Example

This can be useful for example to disable the velocity caches by overriding `velocity.properties` when developing a Confluence plugin.

Create a `src/test/resources/confluence-app/WEB-INF/classes/velocity.properties` file specifying the properties as defined in the [Confluence developer documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Disable+Velocity+Caching). That's it.
