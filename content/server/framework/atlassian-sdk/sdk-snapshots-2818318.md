# Documentation : SDK Snapshots

Feeling brave?

Want to live on the bleeding edge?

We upload every successful SDK build to our <a href="https://maven.atlassian.com/public-snapshot/com/atlassian/amps/atlassian-plugin-sdk" class="external-link">public Maven repository</a>. If you'd like to try a new fix or feature without waiting for the next release, now you can.

A few words of caution are in order first:

-   These are **unsupported** builds. They may work flawlessly. They may have crippling, data-destroying bugs. They may cause demons to fly out of your nose. If that does happen, send us a picture, not a support request.
-   Don't use this on production code or data. Use a separate source checkout and test data.
-   That being said, if you have problems, **please** let us know by filing bugs in the <a href="https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/AMPS" class="external-link">SDK JIRA project</a>.

Finally, if you're motivated enough to try a snapshot build, we think it's likely you can write some code yourself. If you do find a problem - and the fix is something you can do yourself - send us the fix along with your newly filed JIRA issue. The SDK is open source protected by the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html" class="external-link">Apache 2.0 license</a>, and we're delighted to accept your contributions under those terms.
