# Deleting entities

When using Active Objects, deleting an entity requires that you have a reference to that entity. Of course we will be using the `EntityManager`. The actual method is `net.java.ao.EntityManager#delete(RawEntity<?>...)`:

``` java
private void deleteBlog(Blog blog) throws SQLException
{
    entityManager.delete(blog);
}
```

Note that the delete method take a vararg argument so it is possible to delete several entities at once.
