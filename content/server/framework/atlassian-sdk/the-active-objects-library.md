# The Active Objects library

This documentation relates to the Active Objects library outside the scope of the Atlassian plugin framework. Everything documented under this page hierarchy should also apply to using Active Objects within your Atlassian plugin. See the [plugin](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/AO/Configuring+the+Plugin) section for usage of Active Objects that are specific to plugins.

When relevant pages will reference documentation in the [plugin](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/AO/Configuring+the+Plugin) section. Also there might be from time to time inline tips relevant when using Active Objects within a plugin. They will be shown as below:

### Some codeâ€¦

A lot of the documentation in this section references the DogFood blog. It is a very simple blog webapp developed with Active Objects.

I suggest you clone and check out the code available on BitBucket:

-   **<a href="https://bitbucket.org/activeobjects/ao-dogfood-blog" class="uri external-link">https://bitbucket.org/activeobjects/ao-dogfood-blog</a>**

### References

-   <a href="http://java.net/projects/activeobjects" class="uri external-link">http://java.net/projects/activeobjects</a>, this is the Active Objects project on `java.net`. The library is also documented there to some extent.
-   <a href="https://bitbucket.org/activeobjects/" class="uri external-link">https://bitbucket.org/activeobjects/</a>, this is the Active Objects account on BitBucket. A migration of the whole project (i.e. the library) is in the works and ultimately we see all of Active Objects (the library) resources be available there.
