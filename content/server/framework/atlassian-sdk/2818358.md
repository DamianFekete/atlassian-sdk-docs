# Documentation : How to learn to program (in Java or JavaScript)

# Prerequisites

This page is the starting point for aspiring developers who want to someday build an Atlassian plugin or gadget.

This page is for you if:

-   You know programming language(s) that aren't Java or JavaScript

OR if:

-   You aren't already familiar with any programming language
-   You have a very logical and persistent attitude
-   You are prepared to spend months studying a difficult, arbitrary space of knowledge

# Customizing without programming

Atlassian products are flexible and powerful, and many common customizations are available to you without requiring you to write a single line of code. See page *Product Customizations Without Code* for examples of what you can do.

# Learning Java

The Atlassian products are written in the Java™ programming language, originally a product of Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle Corporation. Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it models program code as a set of self-contained chunks that communicate with each other. Most hip modern languages, like C++, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Objective-C, use this same paradigm.

## Why learn Java?

In general, Java is a good choice for study if:

-   You want to learn how object-oriented design works
-   You prefer (or are required) to program for the server instead of the client
-   You want to get involved in the extensive open source community around Java

For Atlassian applications, Java can help you:

-   Understand exactly how the application behaves (since Atlassian <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/licensing-faq.jsp#source_code" class="external-link">provides the source code to paying customers</a>, you can study the product in the most minute detail)
-   Write plugins to add awesome functionality for yourself, your business, or other Atlassian users

## Where should I go to learn Java?

There are a wealth of online tutorials and dead-tree books for learning Java.

-   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" class="external-link">The Java Tutorial</a> - Oracle's online Java tutorial, started in 1995 and kept up to date as the language evolves. Thousands of programmers have learned Java here, including several Atlassians.
-   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Tutorial-Short-Course-Basics/dp/0321334205/" class="external-link">The Java Tutorial: A Short Course on the Basics, 4th Edition</a> - The online tutorial in book form.
-   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208" class="external-link">Head First Java, 2nd Edition</a> - A well-respected book introducing new developers to Java.

# Learning JavaScript

Atlassian Gadgets are written in a combination of XML, a document formatting standard, and JavaScript™, the language of the web browser. JavaScript is a different programming language from Java. JavaScript code is downloaded from the web server and run inside the browser, interacting both with you and the page itself. JavaScript code is used for many websites that offer rich interfaces to the user, such as <a href="http://gmail.com" class="external-link">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="external-link">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com" class="external-link">YouTube</a>.

## Why learn JavaScript?

In general, JavaScript is a good choice for study if:

-   You want to write "thick client" Web applications or richly-featured interactive web pages
-   You prefer (or are required) to program for the client instead of the server
-   You enjoy a high degree of flexibility and style in your work

For Atlassian applications, JavaScript can help you:

-   Write Gadgets - little programs that run in all Atlassian products
-   Customize the look and feel of the application

## Where should I go to learn JavaScript?

As with Java, there are a wealth of online tutorials and dead-tree books.

-   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide" class="external-link">Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript Guide</a> - A comprehensive online guide to the features of JavaScript, as well as an introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM).
-   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742" class="external-link">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> - A slim, fast-reading book on core JavaScript features and good programming practices, but harder to understand for people who've never done programming.

# Programming is hard

The most effective way to learn something is to practice with it at least a little bit every day. Learning programming is difficult but very rewarding. There will be lots of things that don't make sense at first. Study examples wherever you can. Experiment. Try not to get frustrated. Don't expect to become an expert in a week, a month, or even a year. Good programmers never stop learning.

Good luck!
