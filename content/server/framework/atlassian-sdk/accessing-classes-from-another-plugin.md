# Accessing classes from another plugin

If you are building a [dynamic plugin](/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/dynamic-plugin), you can bundle libraries inside your plugin. Place your dependent JARs in the `META-INF/lib` directory (folder) inside the plugin JAR. Any dependency that you specify in your POM will be included in the plugin's `META-INF/lib` directory.

Below is the standard structure of such a JAR, showing the content of plugin's root directory:  
![](/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/images/pluginjarstructure4.png)  
  
And here's the content of the `META-INF/lib` directory:  
![](/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/images/pluginjarstructure3.png)  
  
In the above diagrams:

-   The plugin root directory is `Crowd SAML Plugin`.
-   The plugin descriptor `atlassian-plugin.xml` is at the root level.
-   The classes are located under the `com/atlassian/crowd/plugin/...` directory.
-   The `META-INF/lib` directory contains the dependent JARs.
