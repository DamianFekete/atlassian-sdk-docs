# Plugin Development Platform 2.8 release notes

**27 September 2010**With pleasure, Atlassian presents the **Atlassian Plugin Development Platform 2.8**.

This is our first public announcement of the Atlassian Plugin Development Platform. Using Atlassian's plugin development tools, developers can create plugins that extend the functionality of Atlassian applications such as JIRA, Confluence and others. The Atlassian Plugin Development Platform defines the set of tools a plugin developer can use.

In upcoming releases we will extend the platform to include more of the available tools, making it easier for you to manage dependencies and ensure you have all the components you need.

**Components of this Release:**
