# Trusted application authentication

Trusted application authentication (or 'trusted apps') is an Atlassian-developed mechanism allowing two applications to exchange information on behalf of a logged-in user. For example, an administrator can configure <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" class="external-link">JIRA</a> and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" class="external-link">Confluence</a> to communicate in a trusted way, so that Confluence can request information from JIRA on behalf of the currently logged-in user. JIRA will not ask the user to log in again or to supply a password.
