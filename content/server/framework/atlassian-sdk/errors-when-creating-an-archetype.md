# Errors when creating an archetype

When creating a new archetype (plugin skeleton), you may see errors that look like this:  
"\[ERROR\] ResourceManager : unable to find resource 'VM\_global\_library.vm' in any resource loader."

These errors are harmless, and you can safely ignore them. We hope to eliminate them eventually, and the issue about them is filed internally as XPR-229.
